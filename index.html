			<h2>Welcome To DOGS-R-US</h2>
			<p>You have found us! Peter and Mary Jones welcome you to DOGS-R-US</p>
			<p>We are situated in Southease in East Sussex and are surrounded by
				countryside where we can take our dogs for walkies.
			</p>
				<p>Dog boarding is a much friendlier and safer way have your pet 
					taken care of for you while you are on your holiday or away on 
					business. It's like a home from home to your dog.
				</p>
				<p>Here at DOGS-R-US we "love wet noses"; little ones, big ones,
					 pink ones and brown ones. We care for your little ones as
						if they were our own and make their stay as enjoyable as
						 we can. We know that it's not always easy leaving your
							pets in the care of others, but rest assured they are in
							 very capable and caring hands with us. 
					We have a dedicated team to make your petâ€™s holiday 
					then best we can and of course love, tickles and treats 
					come free!</p>
					<h2>Dog Boarding</h2>
					<p>
						It is just like having your dog looked after by a friend or
						 a family member. Your pet will be able to go on walks, or
							go for runs, and there are other dog walkers with their 
							dogs nearby - your dog will love it here in Southease
						</p>
						<h2>Our Offices Open:</h2>
						<p>9.30am - 12.00pm Collection & Drop Off</p>
						<p>2.00pm - 4.00pm Collection & Drop Off</p>
						<h2>Our Office is Closed:</h2>
						<p>12.00pm - 2pm Monday to Friday</p>
						<h2>Weekend and Bank Holiday Opening:</h2>
						<p>9.30am - 12.00pm Saturday and Sunday.</p>
