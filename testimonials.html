          <article class="testimonials-article"><p>“Peter and Mary are absolute stars, they took my little pup Binky for daily walkies. They were smart and professional when we first met, and you can really tell they care about the dogs! Even when we found out about Binky’s knee issue they helped me look after her while I juggled work and made sure Binky was safe and happy! If you want someone to look after your dog who really cares about them, then Peter and Mary are who you need”</p>

          <article class="testimonials-article"><p>“Peter and Mary have been caring for my ’pride and joy’, Bengy, for just over 6 months. In that time I can honestly say I am over the moon with the service they have provided. In addition to there long, beautiful, scenic walks, they regularly send me pictures and videos of Bengy wagging his tail in the great outdoors. Recently Bengy was unwell with a mystery illness. Peter and Mary went above and beyond to help whilst in there care. Overall, they deserves a 5 star review for an exceptional service. Your pooch could not be in better hands.”</p>

          <article class="testimonials-article"><p>"Peter and Mary are the best! They are both lovely and professional. We have a German Shepherd that can be anxious and difficult. They helped and joined us on our journey in making the dog more social: patiently going through a process of meeting the dog, then being alone with her and really earning both our trust and that of the dog. They even introduced us to a great dog behaviouralist and joined us in a session with him. They have been a marvel, can’t recommend them more!"</p>

Peter and Mary run such a loving, honest and trustworthy business alongside there family to create an amazing environment for the dogs. Suzy  runs to the front door for her stays and she’s just so well looked after and loved here that I NEVER worry.

We’d had pictures and an update whilst we were away as well. Can’t recommend it highly enough will definitely use them next time we need boarding for our dog.?"</p>

If you are anxious about leaving your pooch in someone else’s care, you needn’t be. Regular, honest updates &amp; photos put my mind at rest. Excellent routine in place.
